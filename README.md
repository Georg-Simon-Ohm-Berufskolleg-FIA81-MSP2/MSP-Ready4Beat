We are using a docker-based architecture. This allows us to run this software virtually anywhere and on every OS without a lot of prerequirements. For the routing we use Traefik.

# Installation
Because this software is dockerized, installation is pretty simple.

1. Install docker for your operating system
2. Edit the .env file to match your needs (e.g. domain name)
3. In the App's root-folder run: 
```docker-compose up -d``

From now on the software should be up and running. We are using ports 80 and 443.
